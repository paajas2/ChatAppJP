My name is Jasa Paavolainen and I'm studying in Interactive Media.

I'm mainly interested in game development, but I like dipping my toes in all kinds of
things that may benefit me there. My "main" direction in game development is the graphical
side of things, but I try learning programming and design too. I hope to develop an independent
game of my own some day.

I first took a course on HTML and such about 10 years ago but have since studied it here
in Mediapolis from time to time. Sometimes I study it on my own through Sololearn etc.

I'm not sure what I will or want to be when I'm done studying. Game development is my main goal
in the scope of all things, but so many subjects interest me from writing to voice acting.
Calling me a jack of all trades and master of none wouldn't be too far fetched, though I
like to remind myself of the often forgotten latter part of the quote:
"but oftentimes better than master of one"

Though I originally took this minor kind of at random, it's been interesting getting back
into programming and remembering how complicated it is at times. I enjoy it and hope that
it'll be of use to me in the future even if I may not work in web development specifically!
